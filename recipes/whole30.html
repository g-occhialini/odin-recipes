<h2><p>Description</p></h2>
<p>This is truely <strong>The BEST</strong> Whole30 Lasagna around. </p> 
<p>It tastes like normal lasagna thanks to thin slices of butternut squash (which are used in place of pasta) and a creamy, dairy free “ricotta”.</p>
<p>It’s Paleo, Whole30, Specific Carbohydrate Diet Legal, Dairy Free, Grain Free, Gluten Free and Keto and <strong><em>guaranteed</em></strong> to quickly become a family favourite.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a grain and dairy free lasagna, I don’t think it can get any better then this recipe, bold statement right? I stand by it because this lasagna is <strong>SO GOOD</strong>.</p>
