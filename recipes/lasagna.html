    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>BEST</strong> lasagna is here!</p>
    <p>The ultimate comfort food = homemade lasagna.</p> 
    <p>Family and friends gather around the dinner table at any time for this lasagna recipe.</p> 
    <p>A big warm comforting hug within layers of pasta, tomato sauce, white sauce and melted cheese!</p>
    <p>My mama’s famous lasagna recipe is hands down the best lasagna I have ever had in my life. She learnt her ways from her Italian friends when she lived in New York City, adjusting the recipe through the years to perfect it…and every single person that tries her recipe comes back for seconds, thirds and leftovers for the next day!</p>
    <p>This recipe is not exactly ideal to look at and salivate over in a time that we are all on our low carb, Keto, paleo, weight watchers, cabbage soup, low fat, low carb, rabbit food diets. But…It’s Lasagna. And I DO know that many of us still have to cook ‘normal’ foods for our families.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>
<p><em>Meat Sauce</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add in the onion and carrots and cook for <strong>8-10 minutes</strong>, or until softened. Add in the garlic and sauté for about <strong>1 minute</strong>, until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add beef and pork and cook while breaking it up with the end of your spoon, until browned.</li>
    <li>Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed bouillon and dried herbs. Mix well to combine and bring to a gentle simmer. Season with desired amount of salt and pepper and sugar if needed. Cover and cook for about <strong>20-30 minutes</strong>, occasionally mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly and meat is tender.</li>
    <li>Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Parmesan White Sauce</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Remove from hot plate; add the flour and whisk for about <strong>30 seconds</strong>, or until well blended.</li>
    <li>Place pot back onto stove, reduce heat down to low and slowly whisk in <strong>1 cup</strong> of the milk until well combined. Once well blended, add the remaining milk in <strong>1 cup</strong> increments, mixing well after each addition, until all the milk is used and sauce is free from lumps. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk until it turns into a nice and creamy consistency.</li>
    <li>Increase heat to medium and continue cooking sauce while stirring occasionally until it thickens (about <strong>6-7 minutes</strong>) and coats the back of your wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>Add in the parmesan cheese and remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper and mix until the cheese is melted through.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>To Assemble</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to <strong>350°F</strong></li>
    <li>Spoon about <strong>1 cup</strong> of meat sauce on the base of a <strong>9x13-inch</strong> baking dish, then cover with lasagna sheets. (Trim sheets to fit over the meat if needed.) Layer with <strong>2 cups</strong> of meat sauce (or enough to cover pasta), <strong>1 cup</strong> of white sauce and half of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers (leaving the remaining cheese for the top).</li>
    <li>Pour the remaining meat sauce and white sauce over the last layer of lasagna sheets and top with the remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake for <strong>25 minutes</strong> or until golden and bubbling.</li>
    <li>Garnish with parsley and let stand for about <strong>10 minutes</strong> before slicing and serving.</li>
